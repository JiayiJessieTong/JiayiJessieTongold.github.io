The Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) 2020 is an international, multidisciplinary conference for the presentation and discussion of current research in the theory and application of computational methods in problems of biological significance. Papers and presentations are rigorously peer reviewed and are published in an archival proceedings volume. 2020 marks the 25th anniversary of PSB. PSB 2020 will be held January 3-7, 2020 at the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island of Hawaii.

It's my honor to give a presentation on ["Robust-ODAL: Learning from heterogeneous health systems without sharing patient-level data"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6905508/pdf/nihms-1061510.pdf) on behalf of all other co-authors, Rui Duan, Ruowang Li, Martijn J. Scheuemie, Jason H. Moore, Yong Chen.
