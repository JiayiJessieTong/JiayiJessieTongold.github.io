It is my honor to have the opportunity to rotate in Dr. Jason Moore's lab this semester. The project we've been working on is called: "Application of An Automated Machine Learning Tool to Study Heart Failure with UK Biobank Data". It was a pleasure working with Dr. Moore and the members from his lab. Thank you all for the help!
