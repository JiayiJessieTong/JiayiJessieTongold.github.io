comments: true

I just gave a virtual final presentation of the lab rotation project wit Dr. Jason Moore. I'd like to thank the audience for coming and listening during this difficult time. 

It is my honor to have the opportunity to rotate in Dr. Moore's lab this semester. The project we've been working on is called: "Application of An Automated Machine Learning Tool to Study Heart Failure with UK Biobank Data". It was a pleasure working with Dr. Moore and the members from his lab. Thank you all for the help!

Please take care and be safe, with warmest regards!
