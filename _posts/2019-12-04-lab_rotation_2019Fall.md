It is my honor to have the opportunity to rotate in Dr. Mingyao Li's lab this semester. The project we've been working on is called: "Removal of Batch Effects with Matched Mutual Nearest neighbors in Single-cell RNA Sequencing data". It was a pleasure working with Dr. Li! Thank you very much for all the help!
